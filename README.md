**This repository presents a curated collection of end-to-end Machine Learning and Deep Learning projects developed to demonstrate practical skills across key areas of 
Artificial Intelligence, including Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, and Predictive Analytics. The projects cover real-world problems such as object recognition, 
image super-resolution, text classification, fraud detection, and review score prediction, and showcase the complete pipeline from data preprocessing and model development to 
training, evaluation, and result visualization.**

project:**Object Recognition** 
## Description:
In this project :
* Import datasets from Keras
* Use one-hot vectors for categorical labels
* Addlayers to a Keras model
* Load pre-trained weights/trained weights(in this project i have trained weights considering only 3 epochs since 350 epochs takes approximately 10hrs for training)
* Make predictions using a trained Keras model

The dataset we will be using is the CIFAR-10 dataset, which consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6000 images per class. There are 50000 training images and 10000 test images.

## problem Statement: 
To develop a deep learning model capable of automatically recognizing and classifying objects in images into predefined categories with high accuracy

## Dataset:
we will use cifar10 dataset which can be imported from keras as: from keras.datasets import cifar10

## Tools and Libraries 
*Keras / tensorflow
*python
*numpy

## Accuracy 
60.59% (considering only 3 epochs)

## Results:
